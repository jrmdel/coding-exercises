# Clearing debts

In this exercise, we are given an account between friends with a list of transactions. Each transaction is shared between 2 or more friends, with only one person paying each time.

## 1) Determine each participant's amount

Some participants have paid more than others. Create a list of participants with their positive or negative balances.

Example:

> Jamy: +120
>
> Marcel: -90
>
> Sabine: +10
>
> Fred: -40

## 2) How to even things between them?

It is clearly not balanced. Find the least number of transactions to restore a peaceful equilibrium.

Note: If there are multiple solutions, chose the one where the person with the bigger debt has to make more transactions
